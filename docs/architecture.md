# Architecture Overview

## Multi-Region Resilient Web Application

This architecture provides high availability and disaster recovery across two AWS regions (us-east-1 and us-west-2) with automatic failover capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Networking Layer
- VPC per Region: Isolated network environments in each region
- Multi-AZ Subnets: Public, private, and database subnets across 3 availability zones
- NAT Gateways: High availability internet access for private subnets
- Security Groups: Layered security with least privilege access

### 2. Compute Layer
- ECS Fargate: Serverless container platform for running applications
- Application Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple AZs
- Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts capacity based on demand
- Health Checks: Continuous monitoring of application health

### 3. Database Layer
- Aurora Global Database: MySQL-compatible database with cross-region replication
- Multi-AZ Deployment: Automatic failover within region
- Read Replicas: Improved read performance and availability
- Automated Backups: Point-in-time recovery capabilities

### 4. Storage Layer
- S3 Cross-Region Replication: Automatic replication of static assets
- Versioning: Protection against accidental deletion or corruption
- Encryption: Data encrypted at rest and in transit

### 5. DNS and CDN Layer
- Route 53 Health Checks: Monitors application health across regions
- Failover Routing: Automatic traffic routing to healthy region
- CloudFront: Global content delivery network for improved performance
- SSL/TLS Certificates: Secure communication with automatic renewal

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting
- CloudWatch Metrics: Comprehensive monitoring of all components
- Custom Dashboards: Real-time visibility into system health
- SNS Notifications: Immediate alerts for critical issues
- Log Aggregation: Centralized logging for troubleshooting

## Resilience Features

### High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployment in each region
- Load balancing across availability zones
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Health check-based traffic routing

### Disaster Recovery
- Cross-region database replication (RPO < 1 second)
- Automatic DNS failover (RTO < 2 minutes)
- S3 cross-region replication for static assets
- Infrastructure as Code for rapid recovery

### Fault Tolerance
- Circuit breaker patterns in application code
- Graceful degradation of non-critical features
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Connection pooling and timeout handling

## Data Flow

### Normal Operations (Primary Region Active)
1. User requests hit CloudFront edge locations
2. CloudFront routes API requests to primary region ALB
3. ALB distributes requests across ECS tasks in multiple AZs
4. Application connects to Aurora primary cluster
5. Static assets served from S3 via CloudFront

### Failover Scenario (Primary Region Down)
1. Route 53 health checks detect primary region failure
2. DNS automatically routes traffic to secondary region
3. CloudFront updates origin to secondary region ALB
4. Aurora Global Database promotes secondary to primary
5. Application continues serving from secondary region

## Security Considerations

### Network Security
- Private subnets for application and database tiers
- Security groups with minimal required access
- NACLs for additional network-level protection
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest for all data stores
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.2+
- IAM roles with least privilege access
- Secrets management for database credentials

### Application Security
- Container security scanning
- Regular security updates
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for web security

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- CloudFront edge caching for static content
- Application-level caching for database queries
- Connection pooling for database connections
- CDN optimization for global performance

### Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling of ECS tasks
- Aurora read replicas for read scaling
- CloudFront for global content distribution
- Auto Scaling based on CPU and memory metrics

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Efficiency
- Fargate for serverless compute (pay per use)
- Aurora Serverless for variable workloads
- S3 Intelligent Tiering for storage optimization
- Reserved Instances for predictable workloads

### Monitoring and Optimization
- Cost allocation tags for resource tracking
- CloudWatch metrics for resource utilization
- Regular review of unused resources
- Automated scaling to match demand
